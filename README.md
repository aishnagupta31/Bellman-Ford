# 🔄 Bellman-Ford Algorithm in C++

This project demonstrates the **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**, which is used for finding the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It also detects the presence of negative-weight cycles.

---

## 💡 Features

- Reads a directed weighted graph from user input
- Builds an adjacency list to represent the graph
- Implements Bellman-Ford to:
  - Compute shortest distances from the start node
  - Detect negative-weight cycles
- Handles unreachable nodes with "INF" output

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** for shortest path
- Time Complexity: O(V * E)
- Handles graphs with negative edge weights

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `iostream`, `climits`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Save the code** in a file, e.g., `bellman_ford.cpp`
2. **Compile** using:
   ```bash
   g++ BellmanFord.cpp -o BellmanFord
3.Run the program:
   ./bellman
